## Components

### DataTable

SDSCoredev Components provides an advanced datatable that offer you pagination, sorting, filter 
integration, column settings, query handling, sticky headers and much more. It is based on Equinor 
Design System components to comply with Equinor design standards.

It is created so that developers can easily integrate it into their applications. The complexity that 
a datatable generate over time is avoided by abstractions and combined reducers.
