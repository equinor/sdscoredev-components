# DataTable

SDSCoredev Components provides an advanced datatable that offer you pagination, sorting, filter 
integration, column settings, query handling, sticky headers and much more. It is based on Equinor 
Design System components to comply with Equinor design standards.

It is created so that developers can easily integrate it into their applications. The complexity that 
a datatable generate over time is avoided by abstractions and combined reducers.

So the `<DataTable>` comes these props:

<ArgsTable of={DataTable} />

## `<Column>`

Is used as a child component of `<DataTable>` to define the columns of the table. 

<ArgsTable of={Column} />

## `<Row>`

Can be added as a child if custom settings for the row is needed.

<ArgsTable of={Row} />

## `<ColumnSelector>`

Can be added as a child to provide option to show/hide columns.

<ArgsTable of={ColumnSelector} />

## `<Filter>`

Can be added as a child to provide a trigger button for opening or showing filters.

<ArgsTable of={Filter} />

## `<StickyHeader>`

Can be added as a child to provide sticky header. It will create a dublicate of the `<header>` 
and recalculate all cell widths if window resizes. 

This component is relied on the `<DataTable>` 
having `onScroll={() => stickyHeaderRef.current.handleScroll()}` set. 

This component need the `ref` prop to be set.

<ArgsTable of={StickyHeader} />
